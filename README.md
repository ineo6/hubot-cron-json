Manage hubot cron job defined by json configuration file

## Configuration

All you need to do is just creating `./conf/cron-tasks.json`:

```json
[
    {
        "time" : "0 30 9 * * 1-5 ",
        "msg" : "Good morning ! Let's start morning meeting !"
    },
    {
        "time": "0 45 17 * * 5 ",
        "event": "sample:task",
        "params":{
            "test1":"test"
        }
    }
]
```

`hubot-cron-json` automatically read configuration file and execute job when it's `time` to do. `time` syntax follows ordinal cron syntax, See [http://crontab.org/](http://crontab.org/). 

You can define 2 types of task:

- `mgs` - Just say it to your room.
- `event` - Emit event and another hubot task get it and execute somethig.

And you can check all cron jobs:

```
hubot cron list
```

## Install

```bash
$ npm install --save hubot-cron-json
```

These are cool scripts which also manages cron jobs. But for storing jobs, they depend `robot.brain` (Redis). `hubot-cron-json` manage cron job by json configuraiton file. It's very easy to share same cron jobs to another team's hubot and to run anywhere without job setting. And `hubot-cron-json` can manage not only saying something to room but emitting `event` to invorke another hubot tasks.
